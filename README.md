# HelloWorld
For Crowe

Program has been coded to try and make it easy to switch application types. I used an interface instead of inheritance to help make the switch.

I only rigged the console and a text file to function since those are the easiest. These are instantiated by the Main() with the help of the interface.

I also added a dictionary to play around with a console command since I haven't written one in months. I didn't make it as interactive since this was not part of the request; but I left it in there as something extra.

 Thank you for the opportunity, I really appreciate it.
